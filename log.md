# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Started learning Graph data structure, watched some videos from UC Berkeley and CommonLounge videos about graphs

**Thoughts:** I started learning graph data structure and the usecases.
                        I checked some real life examples of networks, web browsers etc, where grapha are being used

### Day 0: March 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Implemented graph data structure and basic operations like adding edges from scratch in Java

**Thoughts**: The data structure seem to be a bit complicated and needs more learning and in depth undrstanding. Working on implementing and solving some problems may help in achieving the same.

### Day 1: March 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Implemented BFS and DFS using Java

**Thoughts:** Seems like there are a lot of applications for BFS and DFS2018
                        Now I am confident about coding them. I feel, I can code them with out wasting a lot of time

### Day 2: March 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Implemented Graph data structure using using adjacentMatrix and learned garbage collection in java

**Thoughts:** : I should start early to make sure I code enough in the day. I will start working in the morning, so that I can code before I sleep
