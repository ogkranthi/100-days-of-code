# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Started learning Graph data structure, watched some videos from UC Berkeley and CommonLounge videos about graphs

**Thoughts:** I started learning graph data structure and the usecases.
                        I checked some real life examples of networks, web browsers etc, where grapha are being used

### Day 0: March 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Implemented graph data structure and basic operations like adding edges from scratch in Java

**Thoughts**: The data structure seem to be a bit complicated and needs more learning and in depth undrstanding. Working on implementing and solving some problems may help in achieving the same.

### Day 1: March 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Implemented BFS and DFS using Java

**Thoughts:** Seems like there are a lot of applications for BFS and DFS2018
                        Now I am confident about coding them. I feel, I can code them with out wasting a lot of time

### Day 2: March 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Implemented Graph data structure using using adjacentMatrix and learned garbage collection in java

**Thoughts:** : I should start early to make sure I code enough in the day. I will start working in the morning, so that I can code before I sleep

### Day 3: March 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Implemented Graph data structure using using disjoint sets

**Thoughts:** : I could not code much, as I did not want to do it in hurry. To prevent it, I should start early and complete before anything important in the day.

### Day 4: March 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Implemented cycle detection algorithm using DFS and dosjoint sets implementation

**Thoughts:** : I could not code much, as I went out and did other things, which are not so important. I should have completed the coding before I left out.

### Day 5: March 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Studied Socket.io and chat application building, could not code much

**Thoughts:** : There are many things that come up like travelling, etc and I should find a way of working around such situations to complete the code.

### Day 6,7,8,9: March 31,April 1,2,3 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Studied graph algorithms, GIT and ANgularjs interview questions

**Thoughts:** :Need to work more on data structures and algorithms

### Day 10,11: April 4,5 2018

**Today's Progress**: Studied for interview: Angularjs and some front end interview questions

**Thoughts:** : I need to focus on coding and start competetive coding everyday

### Day 12: April 6 2018

**Today's Progress**: Watched videos of trees and traversals from CS61B

**Thoughts:** : I will code them tomorrow
